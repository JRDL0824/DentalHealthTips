      Advertisements make mouthwash seem necessary for good oral health, but many people skip them because they don’t know how they work. 
      Schwartz says mouthwash helps in three ways: It reduces the amount of acid in the mouth, cleans hard-to-brush areas in and around the gums, and re-mineralizes the teeth. 
      “Mouthwashes are useful as an adjunct tool to help bring things into balance,” he explains. “I think in children and older people, where the ability to brush and floss may 
      not be ideal, a mouthwash is particularly helpful.”

      <br>Ask your dentist for specific mouthwash recommendations. Certain brands are best for children, and those with sensitive teeth. 
      Prescription mouthwash is also available.
